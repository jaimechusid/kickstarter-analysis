# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
In this project, I was tasked with helping a playwright, Louise, start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her upcoming play, "Fever". To do so, I have analyzed a large set of crowdfunding data to uncover patterns, and will use my findings to help Louise achieve her goal of raising $10,000. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To perform this analysis, I first created a pivot table that displayed the outcomes of crowdfunding campaigns based on the month it was launched in. To get more specific, I filtered the table to only display campaigns of the "theater" parent category. I also sorted the data by whether the campaign was successful, failed, or was canceled, in order to uncover patterns as to when Louise's crowdfunding efforts would be more likely to succeed. The results are shown below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
